# XBEDIT
A hex editor for Linux terminal I'm working on to learn about executable binaries and for fun.
Since this is an early work in progress, it's currently just a hexdump.

### Features
- Canonical hex dump to terminal
- Executable file format recognition
- Textual User Interface with VIM motions

### Planned Features
- File header parsing PE and ELF formats
- File editing in TUI mode
